## Python Test Driven Development

### Read

* Read the chapter [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html) until 26.2.3.7. Warnings included and [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/2/doctest/).

### What you should learn from this project

- Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
- What's an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic optio flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

### Requirements for Python scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Requirements for Python test cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
example: guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ python3 -m doctest -v ./tests/0-add_integer.txt
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don't miss any edge case
