## Python Classes

### Read

-OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It's VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow. As usual, make sure you type (and as usual never copy & paste), test and understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video). The biggest and most important task of this project is the reading. The project itself will not take you more than 2/3 hours (tests excluded) if you take the time to read and understand everything. Read or watch in this order:

- A simple introduction to Object Oriented Programming without going into much detail:
- Read everything until the paragraph "Inheritance" excluded
- You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet
- Object-Oriented Programming. Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class, in order to make you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything. Read only the following paragraphs:
 - General Introduction
 - First-class Everything
 - A Minimal Class in Python
 - Attributes
 - You NOT have to learn about class attributes
 - Methods
 - The __init__ Method
 - Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
 - Public- Protected- and Private Attributes
 - Properties vs. Getters and Setters
 - TL;DR; - A good wrap-up video about everything you need to know for this project: Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming

### What you should learn from this project

- Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
- What is OOP
- "first-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is self
- What is a method
- What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python

#### advanced:

- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the getattr function

### Requirements for Python scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Requirements for Python test cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don't miss any edge case
