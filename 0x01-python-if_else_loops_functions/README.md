### Read

- Read the chapter [More Control Flow Tools](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/controlflow.html) of [The Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/index.html). Read until 4.6. Defining Functions included (you do not have to read '4.7. More on Defining Functions').
- Also, read these resources: [Myths about Indentation](http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk) and [IndentationError](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QXOd2ZQs-Q).
- Watch: [Learn to Program](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt) and [Learn to Program 2 : Looping](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt).
- Python's got style! [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). [Install and usage](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/231)
- ... and of course, last but not least: ```man python3```
- Note: you do not need to understand lists yet.
